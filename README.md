# Sahil-AI-Adventure-Game-Using-Speech-Synthesis-and-Pose-Recognition-
First of all , I would like to mention that I have chosen An Adventure game using pose recognition  and the following points are going to give a brief of it  --> My project is based on an adventure game in which the main character (Paul) will be operated by the user . It is not only based on Image recognition but the user can also use arrow keys because image recognition might take some time to process while using the monitor as output . As you could see the Design user interface still needs some meddling with , but the coding for image recognition is mostly done while some of it is left for the obstacles in this game . Using Image recognition I have created my own block , while applying image recognition to it as well as the movement of the character by machine learning using images and train my model separately (also I might not be sure to use the same for my final code as It have some faults in it) while making another one which is proper for the understanding the user's action.    So I have also said before that arrow keys will also be allowed if the user wants to select it as an option of more comfort while playing .    But I haven't figured out how to make the story connected to the parts of the adventure game , so I hope that I am able to complete this project before final session.
